<!-- s1 - Create a new Javascript file called index.js and link to it from the index.html 
// s2 - In the Dicee project, there is a folder called images, add the images of dice6.png as the source to both of the <img> elements.
// s3 - Inside index.js, create a new variable called randomNumber1 then set the value of this variable to a random number between 1 and 6. Test it out in the console to make sure it works as expected.
// s4 - Use the random number you created in the last step to pick out a random dice image between dice1.png to dice 6.png then place this image inside the left <img> element.
// s5 - Do the same for the right hand side image element.
// s6 - Change the text in the h1, (which currently says Refresh Me) to show which user won or if there was a draw depending on the dice values of player 1 (left) and playerÂ 2Â (right).
